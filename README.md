## Introduction

The DataScience Bootcamp is a comprehensive program designed to equip aspiring data scientists with the fundamental knowledge and skills required to tackle real-world data analysis and machine learning tasks. Throughout this bootcamp, students learn Python programming and delve deep into popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DataScience Bootcamp, you can either clone this repository or download the course materials directly from the [SmartHub EduTech website](https://www.smarthubedutech.com/datascience-bootcamp). Here's how you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dappa88/DS-Training-2022.git
```

## Course Curriculum

The bootcamp is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic. The curriculum includes the following modules:

1. Python Basics and Fundamentals
2. Introduction to NumPy and Numerical Computing
3. Data Manipulation with Pandas
4. Data Visualization using Matplotlib
5. Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

In each module, you will find Jupyter Notebooks with detailed explanations, examples, and exercises. Additionally, there are datasets provided to practice the concepts taught in the course.

## Setup and Requirements

Before diving into the course materials, ensure that you have the following requirements satisfied:

1. **Python**: The course materials are developed using Python 3. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**: To run and interact with the course materials, it is recommended to have Jupyter Notebooks installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

3. **Required Libraries**: The course materials rely on various Python libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Ensure you have these libraries installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage and Examples

To start the Jupyter Notebook server and access the course materials, run the following command within the repository directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser, where you can navigate to the relevant modules and access the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files). Feel free to explore the course materials, run the code cells, and work on the exercises provided.

Throughout the notebooks, you will find detailed explanations, code examples, and hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding of each topic.
